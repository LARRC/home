# Welcome to Lev Reading Circle!

## What is the purpose of Lev Reading Circle?
- Provide resources, accountability, and direction for students who want to read and learn about institutionalized racism in the US
- Create a nonjudgmental, supportive, and inclusive space for discussion, questions, and education
- Connect topics from history to current times

## How does it work?
* Discussion meets once a week over Zoom.
    * Zoom link here: 
* There will be a list of readings (and other resources) for each week's discussion.
    * Readings will be **short form**: articles and papers.
* During discussion, we will
    * ask and discuss critical questions raised by the readings
    * engage with difficult topics in an open and understanding way
    * try to understand how the history has constructed the present.

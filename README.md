# Welcome to Lev Reading Circle!

## What is the purpose of Lev Reading Circle?
- Provide **resources, accountability, and direction** for students who want to read and learn about **institutionalized racism in the US**
- Create a **nonjudgmental, supportive, and inclusive space** for meaningful discussion, questions, and education
- Connect topics from history to current times

## How does it work?
* Discussion meets once a week **over Zoom**
    * Zoom link here: 
* There will be a list of readings (and other resources) for each week's discussion.
    * Readings will be **short form**: articles and papers
* During discussion, we will
    * **ask and discuss critical questions** raised by the readings
    * **engage with difficult topics** in an open and understanding way
    * try to **understand how the history has shaped current situations and mindsets**

## These guidelines and expectations are vital to maintaining a safe, inclusive, and respectful environment.
### A safe, inclusive, and respectful environment will facilitate open and honest discussion and allow people to make and correct their mistakes. 

1. **Hateful, disrespectful, or discriminatory speech** towards people or groups **will not be tolerated.**
2. **Allow everyone the chance to speak** without interruptions
3. Commit to **learning, not debating.** Comment in order to share information, not persuade or criticize.
4. **Avoid making assumptions** about or based on someoneâ€™s background
5. Do not ask individuals to speak on behalf of their (perceived) social group
6. **Be open to changing your opinion** on a topic
7. Understand that **people are bound to make mistakes**, and respectful discussion is more effective than criticism to correct these mistakes
8. **Differentiate between opinion**--which everyone has--**and informed knowledge**, which comes from sustained experience, study, and practice. Hold your opinions with humility.
9. **Recognize** how **your own social positionality** (e.g., race, class, gender, sexuality, ability) informs your perspectives and reactions to others
10. **Notice your own defensive reactions** and attempt to use these reactions as entry points for gaining deeper self-knowledge, rather than as a rationale for closing off
11. While personal anecdotal evidence is powerful and sometimes necessary for good discussion, **focus on broader group-level patterns**
12. In general, **criticize ideas, not individuals** or groups
13. **What is shared in reading circle stays in reading circle!**
